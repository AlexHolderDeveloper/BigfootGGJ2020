# Sculpture Clash

You're a sculptor tasked with repairing someone's very expensive broken sculpture. You're given an image of what your sculpture should look like, and you can do two things to the broken sculpture in front of you to fix your sculpture: 
1. You can chip bits of the sculpture off.
2. You can drag chipped-off bits of the sculpture back on. 

There's two big problems though: 
1. You can only see the sculpture from one angle.
2. There are other sculptors with the same goal as you - but they're working to create a different sculpture. 

Oh, and another thing - the owner of the sculpture is coming over right now.

They're at the front door! 

Quick! You have 20 seconds to fix the sculpture! 

Go, go, go!
